# Hotel-bookings-analysis

## This is a small project for my university course "AI" that I did with my team

In this project I displayed results of confusion matrix, correlation heatmap, decision tree, and classification report (precision, recall, f1-score) using following libraries (with their modules) - pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.

Here are some of the diagrams
